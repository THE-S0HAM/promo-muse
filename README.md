## 🧠 How It Works

PromoMuse uses a powerful large language model hosted via **Amazon Bedrock** on **AWS PartyRock**.

Once you enter your event details and tone preferences, the app:
1. Prompts the model to generate **catchy taglines**.
2. Asks for **short, engaging poster content**.
3. Produces a **long-form social post** tailored to the selected platform, complete with emojis, CTAs (Call-to-Actions), and formatting.
4. Adds a list of relevant **hashtags** for improved discoverability.

The layout and tone are adapted dynamically based on your inputs to match the intended vibe and audience.
